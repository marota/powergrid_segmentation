# Powergrid Segmentation
This is a repository that lets you reproduce with Informap the result of the paper: "Guided machine learning for power grid segmentation"( Marot, A., Tazi, S., Donnot, B., & Panciatici, P.,In 2018 ISGT-Europe). 
You can analyze the result properties as well as its stability.


You will find 3 notebooks:
* An optional data preparation notebook
* a first notebook to run and analyze the community detection [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/marota/powergrid_segmentation/blob/master/power_grid_segmentation.ipynb)
* a second notebook to run and analyze the community detection in the case we removed non-biconnected component in a preprocessing  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/marota/powergrid_segmentation/blob/master/power_grid_segmentation-noBiConnectedComponents.ipynb)
